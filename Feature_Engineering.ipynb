        "Ordinal Encoding:\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a valley (the loss function). Gradient descent tells you which direction to step in to go downhill.\n",
        "Limitations:\n",
        "Can be slow, especially with large datasets.\n",
        "May get stuck in local minima (suboptimal solutions).\n",

        "\n",
        "Concept:\n",
        "An improvement over standard gradient descent.\n",
        "It updates the parameters using the gradient calculated on a single randomly selected data point (or a small batch) at each iteration.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Instead of calculating the gradient using all data points, SGD calculates it using just one or a few random data points at a time.\n",

        "3. Momentum:\n",
        "\n",
        "Concept:\n",

        "It helps to move faster through ravines, and to avoid getting stuck in small local minima.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Imagine rolling a heavy ball down a hill; it gains momentum and can roll past small bumps.\n",

        "Effectivly it uses a moving average of the gradient, and the squared gradient to adapt the learning rate.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Adam is like having a smart car that automatically adjusts its speed and direction based on the terrain.\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "Generally performs well in a wide range of tasks.\n",
        "Relatively insensitive to hyperparameter settings.\n",
        "5. RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation):\n",
        "\n",
        "Concept:\n",
        "Adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the moving average of the squared gradients.\n",

        "If a parameter recieves large gradients, the learning rate for that parameter is reduced, and vice versa.\n",
